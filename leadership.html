        Literature Resources & Access - 115.50 hrs

        AJR Publications; Los Angeles, Online; Spring '17 - Current

        AJR PUBLICATIONS was a nonprofit-like publishing press I created in order to provide writing and publishing resources to people who otherwise would not have the connections and resources available. As stated on the PHILANTHROPY page, AJR PUB had its run and is now under review in order to become a new and improved publishing press. The primary mission of this upcoming press is to give greater literature access to underprivileged and underserved communities in the hopes that they will raise their voices and use their freedoms to combat their oppressed situations. One major goal that will make the mission of this new press more possible is the establishment of Little Free Libraries in these communities. The new press is still in the creation process, but is well on its way to helping an increasing amount of people.

        Institutionalized Populations - 182.75 hrs

        Inside Books Project; Austin; Spring '14 - Fall '16

        Inside Books Projects is a nonprofit located in Austin, Texas that I volunteered with and worked for during the entirety of my time at the University of Texas at Austin. In fact, IBP is the only nonprofit in the state of Texas allowed to send educational materials and literature to offenders in prisons for free. Because of my time with IBP, I went on to take additional graduate coursework in Criminal Justice with a concentration in Corrections. I also plan to work with institutionalized populations through my upcoming publishing press. My experience with IBP and the offender community helped me realize the nonprofit, volunteering, and philanthropic skills I could utilize because of my English degree.

        Differently-Abled Populations - 22.00 hrs

        Texas School, Blind & Vis. Impaired; Austin; Spring '14 - Spring '15

        I got involved with the Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired - the flagship state of Texas education institution for this population - through a course for my Applied Learning & Development degree. Starting out as a volunteer requirement for the course, being a Guide Runner for the students quickly turned into something I did for a year and a half. I would attend their track practices after school a couple times a week in order to run with specific students as they held onto my arm for guidance. I learned a lot about the blind and visually impaired community; I was able to take what I was learning in the classroom and apply it to my volunteering. And in return, I was able to take real-life experiences back to the classroom to share. This experience inspired me to create the plans of providing audiobook versions of books for the library of the school. Although we never succeeded beyond the planning stage of this event, I have incorporated it into the future of my publishing press.

        Disaster Relief - 144.25 hrs

        United Saints Recovery Project; New Orleans; Spring '14 - Spring '15

        United Saints Recovery Project is a nonprofit organization located in New Orleans that has been dedicated to cleaning up after Hurricane Katrina and other NOLA-based natural disasters for over a decade now. A lot of people don't realize that, even to this day, there is still a lot of debris to clean up and many houses to fix because of Katrina. USRP provides free house-repair services to lower-socioeconomic families that were affected by Katrina and other natural disasters. I spent three semesters traveling to NOLA for a full week each time in order to help this nonprofit change people's lives through free disaster relief services. I learned to further appreciate what I have in my life and the fact that I have never had to endure what natural disaster victims have to experience during and after a disaster strikes. I also learned A LOT about fixing houses. This experience in addition to my service in environment beautification (Keep Austin Beautiful) keeps me aware of the nature around me and why cleaning up litter and keeping everything beautiful is important.

        Education - 54.50 hrs

        VICTORY Tutorial Program; Austin; Spring '14 - Spring '15

        Volunteers In Communities Tutoring Our Responsible Youth (VICTORY) is a joint educational initiative between the City of Austin, Austin Public Libraries, and Austin Independent School District that aims to provide free tutoring and teaching services to every underprivileged and lower-socioeconomic student possible. When I was preparing to become an English teacher at UT, I came across this initiative, which I quickly found myself volunteering with for over a year. I tutored the same child - a middle school student - once or twice a week until he felt educationally-confident enough to leave the program. This helped me understand the self-sustainability that volunteerism is supposed to bring to underserved communities. Before this, I never knew that there was an end goal to service.
