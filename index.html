    <p class=first>Hello,
        <br>​
        <br>
        My name is Austin Robinson and this is my website. I made it for professional and personal reasons. The former being for prospective employers and potential collaborators to see my past, present, and future work. The latter being for the people in my life and all around the world to understand me and my accomplishments better, as well as to provide them with updates.
        ​<br>
        <br>
        The page menu will take you to a variety of content I have experienced and created, from my résumé to my creative portfolio. You'll get a detailed look into my volunteer events, the philanthropic endeavors I founded, my education history, and more. 
        ​<br>
        <br>
        You can connect with me via telephone, email, and LinkedIn. I am available 24/7.</p>
